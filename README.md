# Atomscape - DEMO

**Atomscape** is a fast-paced educational arcade game where you play as a packet of energy, 
bonding with the correct elements to form real-world molecules like water and hydrogen peroxide. 
Complete compounds to earn points and continue your journey through the colorful, scientific world of atoms and molecules!

---

## Features

- Play as a packet of energy
- Bond with the correct sequence of atoms to build a simple molecule (currently only H₂O)
- Limited visuals showing atoms floating and bonding
- Collision detection (wrong bond = game over)
- Timer tracking gameplay duration

---

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- HTML5 Canvas API
- CSS3
- Share Tech Mono font (Google Fonts)

---

## How it Works

- You start as a packet of energy.
- Move with W, A, S, and D keys to collide with floating atoms.
- Collect the right atoms in sequence to form the target molecule (currently only water).
- If you collide with the wrong atom, the game ends.
- If you complete the molecule, the game acknowledges the win.

## Potential Improvements

- Add more molecules to build (e.g., H₂O₂, CO₂, NH₃)
- Launch completed molecules with animation and reset the player to energy
- Implement a score and combo system
- Add visual and audio feedback for bonding and molecule completion
- Introduce difficulty scaling (more/faster atoms, different spawn rates)
- Improve mobile responsiveness
- Add particle effects, backgrounds, and more polish to visuals

## Developer Notes

Atomscape started as an idea to make a colorful, scientific arcade game blending chemistry with fast reactions.  
This project is currently in its demo phase, with only a basic playable system and one molecule (water) implemented.

Further development could turn Atomscape into a full educational game teaching chemistry through fun gameplay.
